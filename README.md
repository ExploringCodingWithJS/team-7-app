### Title of Your Game:
**Emergency Fire Response - Emergent Communication Study**

### Describe the game:
A multi-agent system where **3 emergency response teams** (Fire üî•, Medical üöë, Police üëÆ) must coordinate during a major apartment building explosion crisis. Teams develop their own communication protocols under extreme constraints:

**Core Challenge:** 6 victims trapped across 4 floors with competing team priorities:
- **Fire Team**: Suppress fires ‚Üí Rescue operations (owns heavy ladder)
- **Medical Team**: Immediate victim rescue ‚Üí Hospital transport (needs ladder access)  
- **Police Team**: Evacuation control ‚Üí Traffic management (controls routes)

**Critical Constraints:**
- **Communication**: Originally 8-character radio messages, now flexible length with unlimited transmissions
- **Resources**: 1 shared ladder, 2 ambulances, 1 evacuation route
- **Time Pressure**: 5-minute emergency scenario with escalating crisis events
- **Dynamic Events**: Gas pressure rises, building stability deteriorates, new fires/victims appear

**Success Condition:** Teams win by solving the complete emergency (all victims saved, fires contained, building stabilized, gas controlled) or the game ends after 5 minutes with performance scoring.

## Agent Design

### What makes this game a test of agentic behavior?

1. **Resource Negotiation**: Agents must negotiate shared resources (ladder, ambulances) without central coordination
2. **Dynamic Priority Management**: Teams balance competing objectives (fire suppression vs. victim rescue vs. evacuation)
3. **Emergent Communication**: Agents develop shorthand vocabulary and coordination protocols naturally
4. **Real-time Adaptation**: Agents respond to crisis events (gas pressure, structural collapse) and adjust strategies
5. **Multi-party Coordination**: Success requires 3+ agent coordination, not just pairwise interactions

### Did you design for any specific types of agents or capabilities?

**Agent Architecture**: Each team uses **Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Anthropic API** with specialized system prompts:

**Fire Team Agent:**
- Priority focus: Fire suppression ‚Üí Structure safety ‚Üí Victim rescue  
- Resources: Heavy rescue ladder, water supply
- Capabilities: Assess building stability, coordinate ladder deployment

**Medical Team Agent:**
- Priority focus: Victim rescue ‚Üí Triage ‚Üí Hospital transport
- Resources: Medical supplies
- Capabilities: Request ladder access, coordinate ambulances, assess victim conditions

**Police Team Agent:**
- Priority focus: Evacuation control ‚Üí Traffic management ‚Üí Route clearing
- Resources: None (coordination role)
- Capabilities: Manage evacuation routes, coordinate ambulance access, crowd control

**Key Agent Capabilities Required:**
- **Situational Awareness**: Process crisis state, resource allocation, team statuses
- **Strategic Planning**: Balance immediate needs vs. long-term objectives
- **Communication Protocol Development**: Create efficient emergency vocabulary
- **Resource Competition**: Negotiate fairly while pursuing team objectives

### How does success or failure reflect the agent's performance?

**Primary Success Metrics:**
1. **Problem Solving**: Complete emergency resolution (all victims saved, fires contained, building stable, gas controlled)
2. **Coordination Events**: Successful resource sharing and joint operations
3. **Communication Efficiency**: Vocabulary development and message effectiveness
4. **Time Performance**: Speed of coordination and crisis resolution

**Performance Indicators:**
- **Coordination Success Rate**: Percentage of successful resource negotiations
- **Emergent Vocabulary Complexity**: Shorthand terms, coordination phrases, urgency signals developed
- **Response Adaptability**: How quickly agents adjust to crisis events
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficiency of ladder/ambulance deployment

**Failure Modes:**
- **Communication Breakdown**: Teams talk past each other, no vocabulary convergence
- **Resource Deadlock**: Teams compete destructively for shared resources
- **Priority Misalignment**: Teams pursue conflicting objectives without compromise
- **Crisis Escalation**: Agents fail to respond to deteriorating conditions

## Evaluation

### Emergent Language: Did the language exhibit surprising depth? Did these properties emerge naturally, without being explicitly instructed?

**Yes, the system demonstrates natural language emergence:**

**Vocabulary Development Tracking:**
- **Shorthand Creation**: Agents develop location codes (F1-F4, EW, WW), resource abbreviations (L‚Üí, AMB‚Üí)
- **Urgency Signaling**: Natural adoption of "‚ÄºÔ∏è" prefix and exclamation patterns for critical situations
- **Coordination Protocols**: Teams create action sequences ("L‚ÜíF4-1MIN", "AMB‚ÜíF4-GO") without explicit instruction

**Emergent Properties:**
- **Context-Dependent Meaning**: Same symbols mean different things to different teams
- **Protocol Evolution**: Communication patterns become more sophisticated over multiple games
- **Negotiation Language**: Teams develop implicit bargaining vocabulary ("?", "‚úì", "‚Üí")

**Natural Emergence Mechanisms:**
- **Constraint-Driven Innovation**: Character limits force creative abbreviation
- **Feedback Loops**: Successful communications get repeated and refined
- **Inter-team Adaptation**: Teams converge on mutually understood protocols

### Task Completion: How successfully and efficiently did the agents complete the game objectives?

**Success Measurement System:**
- **Complete Success**: All victims saved + fires contained + building stable + gas controlled
- **Partial Success**: Scoring based on lives saved (100pt), fires contained (50pt), evacuations (25pt)
- **Coordination Bonus**: Points for successful resource sharing events
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Time to coordination, resource utilization rates

**Typical Performance Patterns:**
- **Early Game**: High message volume, resource conflicts, vocabulary experimentation
- **Mid Game**: Protocol stabilization, successful coordinations increase
- **Late Game**: Refined communication, focus on remaining objectives

**Success Factors:**
- **Resource Negotiation Speed**: Teams that establish ladder-sharing protocols early perform better
- **Crisis Responsiveness**: Teams that adapt quickly to gas/stability alerts maintain higher scores
- **Communication Convergence**: Games with faster vocabulary alignment show better coordination

### Domain Realism: Does your game represent a realistic coordination challenge? Why or why not?

**High Domain Realism:**

**Authentic Emergency Response Elements:**
- **Resource Scarcity**: Real emergencies have limited ladders, ambulances, personnel
- **Competing Priorities**: Fire suppression vs. rescue vs. evacuation conflicts occur in real incidents
- **Communication Constraints**: Radio bandwidth limitations and emergency protocols are realistic
- **Time Pressure**: Emergency response windows are genuinely critical
- **Dynamic Conditions**: Real emergencies involve escalating secondary hazards

**Realistic Coordination Challenges:**
- **Multi-agency Coordination**: Fire/Medical/Police coordination mirrors real emergency response
- **Incident Command Structure**: Resource allocation and priority conflicts reflect real systems
- **Communication Protocol Evolution**: Emergency services do develop specialized vocabularies

**Research Validation:**
- **Emergency Management Literature**: Game mechanics align with documented coordination challenges
- **Real Incident Analysis**: Resource conflicts and communication breakdowns are common failure modes
- **Training Scenarios**: Similar to tabletop exercises used in emergency management training

**Limitations:**
- **Simplified Geography**: Real buildings have more complex layouts
- **Reduced Personnel**: Real teams have more complex internal coordination
- **Streamlined Resources**: Real emergencies involve more equipment types

## Additional Questions

**1. Enhanced Realism:**
- **Complex Building Models**: Multi-story layouts with stairs, elevators, ventilation systems
- **Weather Conditions**: Wind affecting fire spread, rain impacting visibility/safety
- **Civilian Behavior**: Non-agent civilians who panic, help, or hinder operations
- **Equipment Failures**: Random resource breakdowns requiring adaptation

**2. Advanced Agent Capabilities:**

- **Cross-Cultural Communication**: Teams with different "cultural" starting vocabularies
- **Information Asymmetry**: Teams with different knowledge about the crisis
- **Communication Channels**: Separate public/private channels for strategy
